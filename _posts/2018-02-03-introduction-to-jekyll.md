# This is my new site, reconfigured to use jekyll!
My old site was a ruby on rails site. Old, clunky, expensive to host. I've decided that it's a good idea 
to swap to Jekyll instead. Here's a few reasons why:

#### Relatively easy to use and create new content.
I was basically creating static pages anyways with my old site, just using the MVC pattern of Ruby. I started to 
work on a more complex replacement using Flask, with an elaborate API backend and a complicated React frontend, however,
as I soon found out, it's actually really tough to create a website that way! I needed a replacement for my old website quickly, and Jekyll seems like the perfect tool to replace it with!

#### Cheap to host
Jekyll is a static site generator: which means that theoretically I can host the site using nothing but a static bucket. I can host the site on Github-Pages for free AND use a custom domain name WITH ssl, which I couldn't do for free on my previous host. However, jekyll is a *static* site generator, which does unfortunately mean that its featuresets are limited. However, while limited, they are just enough for me to get away with completely swapping out my dynamic website for a jekyll site.

#### Way more secure.
The lack of SSL on my previous website meant that logging into it was always a risk, however, Jekyll is a static site generator. There's no need for a production CMS interface, only a text editor and Git. This means that even if I'm not hosting the site on a server protected by SSL, the site is relatively secure, as it's only HTML that is being served, pregenerated, static SSL. 

#### Just really cool
Jekyll is just, awesome. It's a cool concept that I really enjoy working with! It makes managing a website much more... manageable for me, which, in my opinion is just a good a reason as any to use it!

## Things to come.
This is in no way the final iteration of the site. I intend to do several stylistic overhauls, possibly customizing the sites theme in its entirety, giving my set an effective, unique appearance and layout that matches its content. There's also the fact that this site is very devoid of content at the moment. I intend on transferring my previous site's content here, possibly. At least, that content which is relevant to this site.
